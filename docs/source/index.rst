HTBAC: High-Throughput Binding Affinity Calculator
=================================

The Ensemble Toolkit is a Python library for developing and executing 
large-scale free energy binding protocols. HTBAC is a co-design project 
developed by the `RADICAL Research Group <http://radical.rutgers.edu/>`_ at 
Rutgers University and `Center for Computational Sciences Group
 <http://ccs.chem.ucl.ac.uk/>`_ at University College London. HTBAC is 
 released under the 
`MIT License <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_. 

More details about the science enabled by HTBAC can be found in the following
